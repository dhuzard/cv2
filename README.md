# Dhuzard-Resume

Welcome to my personal space... some blog posts, few projects and my CV, nothing crazy!

***
I was originally totally inspired from Roberto De Filippo's one: https://github.com/RobertoDF/RobertoDF.github.io
Please, check it out: https://robertodf.github.io/
Which was in fact used from the one created by Brett Harris website: www.github.com/sproogen/resume-theme.
Big thanks to them!
