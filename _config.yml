            My PhD project is focused on serotonergic modulation of slow oscillations in entorhinal cortex, it led to the publication 
            "Somatostatin interneurons activated by 5-HT<sub>2A</sub> receptor suppress slow oscillations in medial entorhinal cortex (Elife, 2021)". 
            We identified a novel mechanism by which serotonin is able to alter cortical network activity. During the course of this project I employed the following techniques: 
            in vitro patch clamp, silicone probe recording in anesthetized mice, optogenetics, 
            pharmacology, immunohistochemistry and confocal imaging. I also became proficient with Matlab and Python for data analysis.

            Studying social behaviors of mice model of Autism (Magel2-KO and Cntnap2-KO).
            I developped the Social Fear Conditioning protocol and the Live Mouse Tracker system in the laboratory.
