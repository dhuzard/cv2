  Hi, I'm Damien, behavioral scientist or <b> "neuro-physio-behaviorist" </b>.... <br> 
  I like doing and trying stuff, mostly science related. <br>
  My main research interests are gravitating around the concepts of Adaptation, Stress, coping strategies,
  social interactions which are linked to main physiological features  
  such as cardiac regulation and sensory-processing. <br>
  I am an advocate for the biobehavioral phenotyping of animals models, pushing for a description over an interpretation of data! <br>
  Now, I am focusing on analysing the skin as (one of) the first interface linking environnement and behavioral adaptation.
  > I am an expert in <mark>behavior</mark>: protocols and analysis. I'm moderator of  <a href="https://www.thebehaviourforum.org/">TheBehaviourForum</a> <br>
  > I know few Python librairies: <mark>Pandas</mark>, <mark>Scipy</mark>, <mark>Seaborn</mark>, <mark>statsmodel</mark>, <mark>Dabest</mark>, <mark>ipywidget</mark> ...<br>
  > I developped one python library (<a href="https://pypi.org/project/LWTools/"><mark>LMT-Widget-Tool</mark></a>) in order to helping non-python-experts to analyze <mark>live mouse tracker</mark> data. <br>
  > I combine behavioral tests with <mark>physiological</mark> parameters, such as <mark>ECG/HRV</mark> and <mark>Skin-Nerve</mark> recordings. <br>
  My utlimate goal is to improve the way preclinical behavioral research could benefit clinical conditions.

            Studying social behaviors with two mice model of Autism (Magel2-KO and Cntnap2-KO).
            I developped the Social Fear Conditioning protocol and the Live Mouse Tracker system in the laboratory.
            I observed higher social fear retention in both mice model of autism.
            I tried to reduce social fear with positive social interactions (with different social housing conditions)... It only worked in some specific situations.
            ... To be continued ...

                During my PhD thesis I focused on a model of rats selected for differential adaptation profiles to stress.
                Low < Inter < High reaction animals, showed different bio-behavioral profiles.
                Articles from the lab validated the use of the lines as an effective way to study neurodevelopment disorders related to stress pathways.
                I showed that both Low and High lines had abnormal heart rate variability (cardiac susceptibility).
                I observed that High line rats had better working memories after aging: "stress helps consolidate memories"
                while the Low line rats had impaired learning and deficits in memory reversal: "illustrating negative effects of blunted stress responses".
                Finally, by housing rats from the different lines together I obsereved the relative influence of social buffering and social contagion between rats with different 'personalities' (still under preparation...).

                Studying the benefical effects of Enriched Environments on stressed rats.
                Rats were stressed and then housed in enriched environment in social groups (4 males and 2 females).
                We observed beneficial effects of the enrichment on the behavioral phenotype of the stressed animals.
